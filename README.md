# ls-rs
Partial Rust implementation of the ls command on unix/like OS's.

## Notes
This was just a fun little project that I made in a few hours. It's not perfect!

### Funny
If you run this command from root (`/`) it *will* try to print every file or direcotry, depending on the supplied arguments.
